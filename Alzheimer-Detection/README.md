# Alzheimer's Detection

I am currently building and researching different deep neural network architectures to predict Alzheimer's from Brain MRI's. The best model that I developed currently has a 98.74% accuracy which as far as I know is the best result on the dataset. However, I have not used graph neural networks, multi-kernel methods, and layer skipping yet which could yield better results.

Examples of MRI images are below:

![Alt text](pics/Very-Mild-Demented.png?raw=true "Title")

Current Results of best model:  
Testing Loss: 2.92%  
Testing Accuracy: 98.74%  
Testing Precision: 98.74%  
Testing Recall: 98.74%  
Testing AUC: 99.98%  

Upon Acceptance, code will be available here: https://github.com/PaulKMandal/Alzheimer-Detection
