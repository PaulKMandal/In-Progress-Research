# In Progress Research

In order to protect my research, I generally wait until code has been accepted into a journal before making it public. Thus, the following projects are things that I am working on but have not been made open source yet.

## Repositories pending publication
- [Hybrid Resnet Network Architecture for Detecting People from Infrared Images](https://github.com/PaulKMandal/In-Progress-Research/tree/main/IF-Object-Detection)
- [Deep CNN Architecture for Alzheimerâ€™s Detection](https://github.com/PaulKMandal/In-Progress-Research/tree/main/Alzheimer-Detection)
- [Fourier Transfer Network Autoencoder for Long Sequence Text Generation](https://github.com/PaulKMandal/In-Progress-Research/tree/main/IF-Object-Detection)
