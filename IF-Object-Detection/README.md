## Summary of Project 

A variant of the Retinanet neural network using ResNet 50 as a base was trained on about 5000 images from the [FLIR ADAS dataset](https://www.flir.com/oem/adas/adas-dataset-form/). We then filtered images only containing people. Example training images are available here. The motivation of doing this project was to assist fire departments to help save people by using Infrared Camera Footage recorded from drones.
